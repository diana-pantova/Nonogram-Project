Users can create an account with a username and a password  
and use them to log in.
Each account stores the user's data, including level progress.  
Upon sign-up, a seed is generated based on the username, which is then used  
to randomly pick one out of two versions of each level.  

Once logged in, the user can choose to directly play,  
to pick from the level menu, or to change their password from the settings menu.  

The direct play option determines the correct level to boot,  
picking either the next unlocked level (in the case of a new user, the first one)  
or (with priority) the level that is currently in progress.  

Only one level can be in progress at a time. The user can choose
one of their liking from the level progress menu. It displays information  
about each level, whether it's still locked, already completed, or not yet attempted.  

Once the user clears the current highest unlocked level, the next one unlocks.  
In the meantime, they are free to replay any level as many times as they want.  
The account stores the version of the level which was picked innitially, giving  
the user only the option to replay without accessing the different version   
of the level.

The user can choose to go back in most of the menus with a few exceptions.  
In the case of going back from playing, the current board progress is saved in the account.  

The gameplay works through coordinates and commands.  

Game must be played with the console on fullscreen, because otherwise  
scrolling is created, which messes with the console commands of the program  
and cannot be reversed without reprinting the entire board,  
which is a very long task.
